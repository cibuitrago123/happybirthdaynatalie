# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for revamping the existing birthday webapp into an operating-system like homepage that provides file management capabilities. The system will transform from a static birthday message into an interactive desktop environment with file icons for "Photos" and "Date Ideas" that provide photo upload and note-taking functionality respectively.

## Glossary

- **OS_Homepage**: The main operating system-like interface that displays file icons and manages user interactions
- **Photos_App**: The photo management application that handles image uploads and display
- **Date_Ideas_App**: The note-taking application for managing date ideas and text content
- **Music_Player_App**: The music application that handles MP3 uploads and audio playback
- **Happy_Birthday_App**: The application that displays the original birthday message content
- **File_Icon**: Visual representation of applications that users can click to launch
- **Lightweight_Backend**: A free, bare-bones storage solution for persisting user data (photos and notes) without requiring paid services
- **GitHub_Pages**: The deployment platform that hosts the static webapp
